# simple-react

This repository aims to provide a simple React implementation as a practical platform for learning and exploring the internal workings of the React architecture and its source code. By building this streamlined version of the React library, we gained a deep understanding of React's core concepts, life cycle, how virtual DOM works, and the component development model.
